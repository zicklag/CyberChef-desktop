# CyberChef Desktop

Unofficial desktop builds of [CyberChef] using [Tauri].

Download installers for your platform from the [Releases] page.

## Release Process

Releases are automatically built for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, but must be manually triggered, so if there is a new release of CyberChef out that we don't have a Desktop build for yet, open an issue and we'll get the release made!
